PicList is an efficient cloud storage and image hosting platform management tool. Building upon the foundation of PicGo, it has been deeply modified and enhanced. Not only does it retain all of PicGo's features, but it also adds many new ones. For instance, the album now supports synchronized deletion of files in the cloud. Built-in image hosting options have been expanded to include WebDav, local image hosting, and SFTP. Additionally, PicList introduces comprehensive cloud storage management functions, including cloud directory viewing, file search, batch uploading, downloading, and file deletion, copying links in various formats, and previews for images, markdown, text, and videos. Moreover, it boasts a more powerful album function and numerous other improvements and enhancements.

## How to migrate from PicGo

PicList `V1.5.0` and above versions provide the `one-click migration` function. Enter the `Settings` page, and then click the right button on the `Migrate from PicGo` option to migrate. Please restart the application to take effect after migration.

## PicList-Core

The core of PicList is based on the original PicGo-Core [PicList-core](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/PicList-Core), which is adapted for cloud deletion and other functions, and adds watermark addition and image compression / scaling / rotation / format conversion functions, which can be called through CLI command line, support starting the built-in upload server through `picgo-server`，as well as some other function changes.

if you want to use PicList-core, please go to [https://github.com/Kuingsmile/PicList-Core](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/PicList-Core), or go to [npm official address](https://www.npmjs.com/package/piclist) to view the installation instructions.

## Features

- Retains all the features of PicGo and is compatible with the vast majority of existing PicGo plugins, including integrations with software like Typora and Obsidian.
- Added multiple built-in image hosting platforms, such as WebDav, Lsky Pro, local image hosting, SFTP and Telegra.ph. The original built-in imgur image host now also supports account login for uploading.

## How to use

### How to use in VScode

Please install my matching plugin [VS-PicList](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kuingsmile.vs-piclist), compared with the vs-picgo plugin, the plugin directly depends on the PicList desktop software, supports a variety of uploads and direct cloud deletion in Vscode and other functions.

### How to use in Typora

#### **Version 1.6.0-dev and above**

**Typora 1.6.0-dev and above versions now support PicList natively**

Now you need to set the upload service PicList and PicGo (app) to the installation path of PicList at the same time, it has been fixed in latest dev version.

[download link](https://typora.io/releases/all)

#### **Version < 1.6.0-dev**

Windows:

Enter the Typora settings page, select the image, set the upload service to `PicGo(app)`, and then fill in the installation path of PicList in `PicGo path`, as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96409857/226522101-b3531b7b-534c-4149-b527-8738d4ebb041.png)

Or, you can also use the `npm install piclist` command to install PicList-core, and then set the upload service to `PicGo-Core(command line)`.

MacOS:

Enter the Typora settings page, select the image, set the upload service to `Custom Command`, and then fill in `/Applications/PicList.app/Contents/MacOS/PicList upload` in `Command`, as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96409857/226645570-4c6e06a5-5bd9-40c3-a21d-8446c66325e3.png)

The verification of the upload option may have problems, you can ignore it, and use it directly.

### How to use in Obsidian

In the community plugins, search for and install the Image auto upload Plugin. Next, go to the plugin settings page and change the default uploader to PicGo(app). Set the PicGo server to `http://127.0.0.1:36677/upload` as shown in the image below. Additionally, this plugin also supports cloud-based deletion through PicList. To use this feature, enter `http://127.0.0.1:36677/delete` in the deletion interface.

### How to use in docker

#### docker run

Change the `./piclist` to your own path, this is the path where you put your `config.json` file, and change the `piclist123456` to your own secret key.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name piclist \
  --restart always \
  -p 36677:36677 \
  -v "./piclist:/root/.piclist" \
  kuingsmile/piclist:latest \
  node /usr/local/bin/picgo-server -k piclist123456
```

#### docker-compose

download `docker-compose.yml` from piclist-core repo, or copy the following content to `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  node:
    image: 'kuingsmile/piclist:latest'
    container_name: piclist
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 36677:36677
    volumes:
      - './piclist:/root/.piclist'
    command: node /usr/local/bin/picgo-server -k piclist123456
```

You can change the `./piclist` to your own path, this is the path where you put your `config.json` file, and change the `command` to your own secret key.

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Mac special instructions

If the macOS system installs PicList and displays "file is damaged" or installs and opens without response, please upgrade to PicList V1.4.1 or above.

After V1.4.1, all mac installation packages have been signed by my developer certificate, will not be recognized by the macOS system as "malicious software", will not appear "file is damaged" prompt.

### Mac App Store

Due to the sandbox mechanism of Mac App Store, many functions cannot be used normally, so the installation method of Mac App Store is no longer supported.

If you have purchased PicList through Mac App Store, please add my WeChat `pku_sq_ma`, I will refund you.

Thank you again for your support for PicList.

**Of course, if you don't want to pay, you can also download the free installation package through Github to install.**
